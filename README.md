# Rectangle-Solver
An algorithm that organises triangles or rectangles 
I wanted to write an algorithm that moves randomly distributed triagles or rectangles around to optimise the number of intersections in the whole picture. 
This code is perhaps more of an art than a science project but the final results were pleasing.
